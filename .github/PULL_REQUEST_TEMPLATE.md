## What changes?
A simple description of what has been done, you can add important code blocks, images and links if you think it helps. Another recommendation is to leave a description over each of the commits on the PR, but do it just if the commit is too big, or if the commit message isn't descriptive enough.

## Was it tested? How?
When you create changes, you should provide some tests that prove what you made works, it can be unit tests, or anything. However, is the testing means much work, or you are just fixing a little bug, a "Tested locally" can be accepted while the current CI checks passes.

## Is there a GH Issue involved on the development of this PR?
Most of time it should be, a link added is much appreciated, if a GH Issue is provided, make sure of put how much of the Issue has been solved, if you can set a list of TODOs it would be of great help!
