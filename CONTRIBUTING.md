# Contributing Guidelines

Hello! Thank you for looking on our source code, and even more if you are willing to contribute. In SLC-wms we encourage Open Source practices, that's why we have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SLC-wms/DSL-Architecture/tree/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we'll be glad if you can read before contributing. Also, if you think there is any issue with our software, please take a look con our [Security Policy](https://github.com/SLC-wms/DSL-Architecture/tree/main/.github/SECURITY.md) before publishsing anything on Github's Issues.

Anyways, that's enough talk, let's get to the point. You want to participate in our development, right?

## Github Issues
In terms of Github's Issues, please use any of our predefined templates, it will make an easier work for the both of us. However, if our templates doesn't match what you are trying to tell us, then try your best to be clear, even if it takes many words, we prefer a better explanation than doing it fast, but if you can provide both, we'll be happy to help! Finally, please look for your found issue in our open issues, if it's already reported, then leave a comment, it will light up that the issue require more attention.

# Doing a Pull Request
What about Pull Requests? We provide a template on what is the least you shall provide about your contribution, if any of the fields that we set doesn't apply to your contribution, then don't fill it, is okay.

On terms of our conventions, we use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), however, if you want to start fast, we can work with a simple version of just committing like this:

```
[feat/fix]: [A verb] [What you did] [Any context]
Here are some examples:
feat: Added a scrollbar component on the Billing page
fix: Removed the silent bug on the model's service
```

And, to finish up, we take in count the Developer's Certificate of Origin, so please read this before helping out, as you are required to accept and follow these restrictions.
